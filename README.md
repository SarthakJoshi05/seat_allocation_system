Got it 👍 — you mean a **clean `README.md` file content** that you can directly copy-paste into your repo.
Here’s the properly formatted full copy:

# Exam Seat Allocation System

A Laravel 12 application for allocating students to exam seats across multiple rooms with rules for fairness, department separation, subject mixing, gender balance, and support for students with special needs.

---

## 🚀 Requirements

- **PHP** 8.2+
- **Composer** (latest)
- **PostgreSQL** (installed and running)
- **Node.js & NPM** (only if compiling assets, otherwise Bootstrap 5 via CDN works)

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
composer install
````

Copy the example environment file and generate an app key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup

This project uses **PostgreSQL**.

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE seat_allocation_system;
```

2. Update your `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=seat_allocation_system
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
```

3. Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

4. Seed the database with sample data (students, rooms, etc.):

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ExamSeeder
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

### Run Seat Allocation (CLI)

```bash
php artisan seats:allocate
```

This will:

* Read all students and rooms
* Apply seat allocation rules
* Save results to the database
* Output logs/JSON with room-wise seating maps

### Web Interface

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
2. Open in your browser:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/seats
   ```
3. Use the **Allocate Seats** button to trigger allocation and view room-wise seating maps (Bootstrap 5 tables).

---

## ⚙️ Queue Notes

* By default, the project runs the allocation **synchronously**.
* If you switch your `.env` to use `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`, you’ll need to run:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
php artisan queue:work
```

This will process allocations in the background.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* `app/Models/` → `Student`, `Room`, `SeatAllocation`
* `app/Console/Commands/` → `SeatsAllocate` command
* `app/Services/` → `SeatAllocationService` (allocation logic)
* `database/seeders/` → `ExamSeeder` (sample data)
* `resources/views/seats/` → Bootstrap 5 UI for displaying room-wise maps

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

* Room capacity enforcement
* Department separation (no two adjacent seats from same department)
* Subject mix distribution
* Gender balance within rooms
* Special needs seating rules (edges/corners with adjacent empty seat)
* Room-wise seating map output (JSON + UI)

Do you also want me to include a **step for uploading screenshots** (since your instructions said you must upload each and every screenshot), so it’s part of the README checklist?
